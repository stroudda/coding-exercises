Dangers of rising CO2
========================================================

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

CO2 levels have been continuosly rising since the industrial revolution due mostly to the buring of fossil fuels.  Whenever the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has gone up, the temperature of Earth has also gone up. When the temperature goes up, the CO2 in the atmosphere goes up even more.

- CO2 in the atmosphere works to trap heat close to Earth
- Excess carbon in the atmosphere warms the planet and helps plants on land grow more. 
- Excess carbon in the ocean makes the water more acidic, putting marine life in danger
- Heat trapped from excess CO2 melts glaciers and causes the Earth'd temperature to rise


Predicting CO2 Levels
========================================================

Being able to predict CO2 levels will give better insight into future weather patterns. 

- Knowing what future levels will be at will allow humans to react sooner to prevent overheating
- CO2 levels are cyclical and predictable
- Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2 Concentration data going back to 1959 allows for accurate predictions
- Using the forecast library in R we can predict future CO2 levels

CO2 Concentration Predictor
========================================================

Here is a [link](https://tamcknight.shinyapps.io/week_4/) to the interactive Shiny application. It allows you to predict the next 12 months of CO2 and to test out different time periods.

```{r}
library(forecast)

    minYear <- 1990
    maxYear <- 1997
    data.subset <- window(co2,start = c(minYear,1), end = c(maxYear,12))
    plot(forecast(data.subset, 12), xlab = "Year", ylab = "CO2 Concentration", type = 'l')

```


Benefits of the Application
========================================================

Being able to predict CO2 levels is highly benefitcial which is why people should use this app.

- Ability to understand future temperature increases the ability to react
- Prove to people that CO2 levels will continue to increase without change
- The app is cool
- It is free and [open source](https://github.com/tamcknight/coding-exercises/tree/master/coursera_homework/developing_data_products/week_4)
